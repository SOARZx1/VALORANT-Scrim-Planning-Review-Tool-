Project Type - Operations & Production Workflow Mock

Game - VALORANT

Role - Game Producer (Self-Directed)

Overview:

This project proposes a structured scrim planning and review workflow for VALORANT teams to improve practice quality, accountability, and iteration.
The system focuses on scheduling, goal-setting, post-scrim review, and follow-up actions, helping teams practice with intention rather than repetition.

Problem Statement:

Many competitive VALORANT teams run scrims inconsistently:

- Goals are unclear or not communicated
- Feedback is unstructured
- Learnings are not tracked across sessions
- Improvements are difficult to measure over time

Goals & Success Metrics:

- Improve scrim organization and clarity
- Increase accountability for follow-up actions
- Enable iterative team improvement
- Clear goals defined before each scrim
- Action items tracked and completed
- Reduced repeated mistakes across sessions
- Positive team feedback on practice quality

Workflow Scope:

In Scope:

- Scrim scheduling and opponent tracking
- Defined practice goals per session
- Post-scrim review template
- Action items with ownership
- Lightweight tracking system (Sheets or simple script)

Out of Scope:

- Automated stat ingestion
- In-client integrations
- Real-time match analysis

Workflow Breakdown:

Before Scrim:

- Define practice goals
- Confirm opponent, maps, and schedule

During Scrim:

- Focus on predefined objectives

After Scrim:

- Capture what worked and what didn’t
- Assign action items with owners

Between Scrims:

- Track completion
- Adjust goals for next session

Cross-Discipline Coordination:

- Players: feedback and execution
- Team lead / coach: goal definition and prioritization
- Producer: scheduling, documentation, follow-up, iteration

Risks:

- Low adoption
- Feedback overload
- Process fatigue

Project Management:

This workflow was planned and managed using a Kanban board in Jira, tracking work across Backlog, Ready, In Progress, QA, and Done to maintain clarity and execution flow.

A single Jira board screenshot is included to demonstrate execution planning.
